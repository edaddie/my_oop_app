Step-by-step instructions to install Git on Windows 11:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/download/win

2. The download for Windows should start automatically. If not, click the link to download the Git installer for Windows.

3. Once the installer is downloaded, run the installer executable.

4. Follow the installation wizard steps:
   - Select the default options unless you have specific preferences.
   - Important: When you reach the "Adjusting your PATH environment" step, choose "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" to ensure Git is added to your system PATH.
   - Continue with the default options for the rest of the installation.

5. After installation completes, open a new terminal or command prompt window.

6. Verify Git installation by running:
   git --version

   You should see the installed Git version printed.

Once Git is installed and recognized, please let me know, and I will continue with creating the feature branch, modifying files, and pushing to GitHub.
